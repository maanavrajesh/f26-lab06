# Contract Worksheet

One section per milestone. Fill each one in as you go, in order. Write each
prediction before you run anything. That is the part a TA asks about.

Keep it short and specific. Point at methods, call sites, and error text.

---

## Milestone 1: The notes overload

### Prediction (write this before you run the build, and you can deliberate with your agent)

**Will the consumer, untouched, still compile and pass?** Yes or no.

Yes.

**Why.** What does the compiler do with the consumer's existing call sites once
the new overload exists?

Java picks an overload at compile time partly by argument count. Both
`FrontDesk` calls (lines 27 and 33) pass 4 arguments, so they still bind to
the 4-arg `createBooking` and can't match the 5-arg one, even the `null` call.
The consumer only calls `BookingApi` and doesn't implement it, so the new
abstract method only has to be implemented in `InMemoryBookingService`, which
we own.

### What happened

**The result.** What the build printed for each module.

```
lab06-api:      Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
lab06-consumer: Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
BUILD SUCCESS
```

**If your prediction was wrong,** say what you missed.

It was right. The consumer didn't notice: its 4-arg calls compiled against the
same method, and their behavior didn't change because the 4-arg version just
delegates with `notes = null`.

**Is an additive change always safe in Java?** One case where adding something
to an API still breaks a caller, if you can name one.

No. Adding an abstract method to `BookingApi` breaks any outside class that
implements it, since that class no longer compiles until it adds the method.
A `default` method would avoid that. An overload can also cause ambiguity:
adding `createBooking(String, long, long, Integer)` would make
`createBooking(room, s, e, null)` in `FrontDesk` fail to compile.

## Milestone 2: The request object

### Prediction (write this before you run the build)

**Will the untouched consumer still compile and pass?** Yes or no, and if no,
which module goes red and whether at compile time or test time.

**Where.** Name the call sites you expect to be affected, if any.

**What about the tests in `api/`, after you update them?** And whether their
result is evidence about the consumer.

### Step 1: after the fold

**What the build printed.** Paste it for each module, including file and
line for anything that failed.

**Which module's tests ran, and which did not.** And what that tells you about
who can detect a contract break.

### Step 2: the deprecation path

**What you added.** The signatures that came back, and what they delegate to.

**The warnings.** Paste one deprecation warning line from the build log (from
a `mvn -B clean test` run, since a rerun with nothing to compile prints none).

**What the deprecation path resolves.** Who can now build that could not build
during step 1, and who is on which schedule.

**What the warnings accomplish that a README note would not.** Be concrete
about where the warning shows up and who sees it without looking for it.

## Milestone 3: The misuse critique

Not coded. One misuse, one redesign, one cost. Discuss it with your TA.

### The misuse

**What is easy to get wrong.** One specific thing about the API surface.

**The call site.** File and line in `consumer/`, with the call. Show the
code that a reader cannot understand without opening the javadoc, or that a
caller could get wrong with the compiler still happy.

**What goes wrong when it happens.** Silent bad behavior, wrong data, a crash
somewhere far away?

### The redesign

**The proposal.** Types, enums, factories, or whatever you are proposing. Show
the new signature and the new call site.

**Why the mistake is now hard or impossible to make.** Point at the mechanism,
such as the compiler, a validating constructor, or an exhaustive switch.

### One tradeoff

**What it costs.** Something real, such as caller ceremony, migration burden
against the deprecation path you just built, or more types for a newcomer to
learn. "No real downside" does not count.

**When the price is worth paying.** A condition under which it is.
